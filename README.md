Feel free to contact me on Discord for Support for this script. Find username in READ ME file in the folder :)

Drag and Drop "SifuhlisPhoneTrace" into your resources folder and ensure the resource in your server.cfg!

How does it work?
This script works by getting the Item "Phone" from the Players inventory where phone = phoneNumber and then checks to see if the phone is online by converting the phone number to the player ID.
Police officers can use "/track {phonenumberhere}" to track a phone number that will give the location of the suspect with 30 second intervals! (you can change this by going to server.lua and looking for the "Citizen.Wait(30000)" function. Remember btw, 1000 = 1 second, 2000 = 2 seconds, etc.
 
Please note that this was made for Quasar Smartphone Pro on the QBCore Framework.
This is my first script for FiveM, so please go easy on me if there's errors that show up.
